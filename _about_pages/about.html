<h2 class="one"> About </h2>
<p>I am a Signal Processing Researcher and Data Scientist.  Currently, I work at Bastille where I am helping to build new and cool radio frequency (RF) technologies with the goal of providing security for the Internet of Things.  </p>
<p>Prior to joining Bastille in 2014, I held various faculty positions at Georgia Tech.  Most recently, I served as the Director of the Software Defined Radio Lab (SDRL), where I researched and built cognitive radios.  I currently hold an adjunct appointment at Georgia Tech through which I advise graduate students and teach courses.</p>
<p>My academic background is in statistical signal detection, estimation theory, and machine learning. </p>
