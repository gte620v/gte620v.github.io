    "I have dabbled with d3js for a while, and I am a junkie for the visualizations that the <a href=\"http://nyt.com\">New York Times</a> released that are written using d3js.  I recently did a project with <a href=\"https://anidata.org\">Anidata</a> that involved creating, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing network graphs in python (more on that in a future post).  \n",

    "NetworkX is a great tool for doing all of these things and I started the project by plotting with NetworkX. The project culminated in a presentation and I felt that the impact on the audience of the result was less compelling with a static plot from NetworkX.  Inspired by some Notebook hacking that I've been exposed to by <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyfast\">Tony Fast</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/bollwyvl\">Nicholas Bollweg</a> did, I decided to have a go at embedding d3js visualizations in a Jupyter Notebook.  \n",

Seeing the code in the `motionchart` package was an epiphany for me as it was a straightforward wrapper around a javascript code base with nice utility functions to export to html, the clipboard, or directly into a Notebook cell.\n",
