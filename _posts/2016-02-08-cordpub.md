## [{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url }})
I made a javascript library out of the code I use to render my publication list.  The library is called _cordpub_ and is available at [https://github.com/gte620v/cordpub](https://github.com/gte620v/cordpub).  The use case of the library is to allow you to keep data in a [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) document.  So, for instance, most of the data that drives the static pages on this site are kept [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QdKhXtFd-8GEcvX52PuM4zlAckenq999Nvs3iEUkRVc/edit?usp=sharing).

In the simplist form, cordpub can be used to basically skin the data in a spreadsheet into a HTML page like I have done on my [CV page](http://rjbaxley.com/cv.html).  Or, if your data is a list of publications with authors, you can enable the cord plot feature to show the graph of coauthors. The result is a [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) driven graphic like this:
