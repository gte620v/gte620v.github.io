<p>Ever wonder which frequencies your IoT devices are using? Wonder no more: all wireless device manufacturers have to file paperwork with the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a> when they sell a device. The filing includes user manuals, a description of the device, a block diagram, operational descriptions, test reports, and photographs of the device. Under <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/comments/GetPublishedDocument.html?id=234&amp;tn=911909" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/comments/GetPublishedDocument.html?id=234&amp;tn=911909">certain circumstances</a>, some of these documents can be kept confidential; but the test report is always made public.</p><p>Luckily for all the SDR hackers out there, the test report often contains key information required to decode and perhaps even hack a wireless device. Namely, the test report submitted to the FCC will contain center frequency, channel, bandwidth, and modulation information. Couple this insight with a software-defined radio (SDR), and a little bit of code, and we can do some really cool things.</p><p>For fun, let’s query the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm?calledFromFrame=N" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm?calledFromFrame=N">FCC database</a> for all original equipment applications in the past year that emit in the UHF frequencies between 600MHz and 700MHz. It is truly an IoT—we see everything from a fetal monitor (FCC ID <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=174714&amp;fcc_id=PQC-OBRBSBV1" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=174714&amp;fcc_id=PQC-OBRBSBV1">PQC-OBRBSBV1</a>; 111kHz channels w/ GFSK modulation at 608-614 MHz) to a wireless microphone system (FCC ID <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=168908&amp;fcc_id=DD4PA411A" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=168908&amp;fcc_id=DD4PA411A">DD4-PA411A</a>; 200kHz channels w/ FM modulation at 488 - 698 MHz) to a set-top box (FCC ID <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=308273&amp;fcc_id=G95C51" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=308273&amp;fcc_id=G95C51">G95-C51</a>; RF4CE Zigbee) to 4G routers (FCC ID <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=413894&amp;fcc_id=PY313400244" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=413894&amp;fcc_id=PY313400244">PY3-13400244</a>) and phones (FCC ID <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=151855&amp;fcc_id=BCG-E2816A" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=151855&amp;fcc_id=BCG-E2816A">BCG-E2816A</a>).</p>

These protocols inevitably introduce unforeseen wireless security vectors that will need to be monitored and mitigated.</p><p><br></p>
